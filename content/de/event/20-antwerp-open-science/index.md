summary: Invited talk about open science practices in public administration research.
abstract: "In 2015 the Open Science Collaboration published the results of their large-scale replication of 100 published findings in psychology. The surprisingly low replicability of results published in top journals sparked the so-called credibility crisis in psychology. Researchers in psychology but also in many other social sciences, started to question their traditional ways of doing and publishing research. Many concluded that a more open type of science was necessary to regain credibility for social science. This development leaves us with the question, what conclusions public administration as a discipline draws from what is happening in other disciplines. What did we learn? What did we change? And what do we still need to change?"
