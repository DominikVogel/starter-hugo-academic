 abstract = {In many cases, public management researchers' focus lies in phenomena, embedded in a hierarchical context. Conducting surveys and analyzing subsequent data require a way to identify which responses belong to the same entity. This might be, for example, members of the same team or data from different organizational levels. It can be very difficult to collect such data in environments marked by high concerns for anonymity and data privacy. The purpose of this paper is to suggest a procedure for matching survey data without compromising respondents' anonymity.}
