Open science plays an important role in my work. The term Open Science covers a variety of efforts to make research and its results more transparent and reliable. This includes among other things:

* **Open Access**: Open access to research results, especially publications
* **Open Data**: Open access to the data, which were used to produce research outputs 
* **Open Materials**: Open access to materials, which were used to conduct research and produce results

To increase (or restore) trust in science and to produce a reliable body of scientific knowledge, science has to become more open. I, therefore, strive toward including open science practices in my work. I already preregistered some new research projects, and I am planning to make my materials, analysis code, and data available. I also publish open access post-prints of [all my publications](../publication) after the respective embargo periods expired.
