Research on the interaction between citizens and public administrations from the perspective of individual citizens is a relatively new stream of research. However, this perspective is very important, as it is fundamental to the acceptance of public administration by citizens. It also plays an important role in the trust citizens have in public administrations.

In this research area, I look at citizens from two perspectives. Firstly, citizens as stakeholders interacting with the administration from an outside perspective and forming an **opinion about the administration**. Secondly, citizens as **potential applicants** for a job in the public sector.
